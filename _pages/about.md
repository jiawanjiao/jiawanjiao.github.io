My Workstyle
======
1. I care about my students. They are not the only but the most important part of my job.
2. But work is only part of my life, my faith and my family are also very important parts of my life. So, I work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. I don't work on holidays, including weekends. Holidays are holy, which is different from workdays. I also don't work in the evening, which is family time and for me to relax.
3. I am your supervisor, not an AI or a machine. It is my job to help you improve the quality of your thesis. Every button in the system that I need to click and every document that I need to sign are proving this. It is not natural for me to click or sign unless your application documents meet the required standards.
4. I need time, which is at least one week, to read the emails and documents you send me and give useful suggestions. One week is needed because I have a lot of other work to do, including teaching, writing papers and mentoring other students.

Your duties
======
Thesis belongs to you, degree belongs to you. So the following are your duties.
1. Pay attention to all the standards, rules, and deadlines.
2. Before every node, reach out to me during my work hours, leave me enough time to give suggestions, and leave yourself enough time to revise.
3. Take my advice, unless you can convince me with good reason and sufficient evidence.
4. Remind me to go to the graduate management system audit, I don't log in every day to check.
5. Send files by email instead of WeChat.
6. Reply to any emails and messages I send.
